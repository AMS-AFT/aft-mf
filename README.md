# AFT Meta Framework

This meta framework aims to provide stable, tested and quality code for the development of frontend applications, regardless of the JavaScript framework you want to use. It will also provide adaptations for the different reference frameworks, such as Angular or React, sharing in all cases the same reference API.

It will consist of a series of independent code libraries without external dependencies and different implementations, each with its own dependencies to avoid unnecessary ones in the projects that use them.
